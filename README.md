# DiscordToken-Info - @spinozapy

<h3>This Python-based Discord Token Info tool allows you to retrieve details associated with a Discord user's token.</h3>

<h4>Run "python main.py" in the command line, input the token, and acquire information about its owner.</h4>

<strong>Note: Safeguard your token and refrain from sharing it. Using someone else's token implies unauthorized access and violates Discord's terms of service.</strong>
